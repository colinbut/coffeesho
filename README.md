## Coffee Shop

In a typical coffee shop you as a Customer go inside. You order. The cashier takes your order. The cashier then passes it on to the Barista who makes your order. At the same time, you pay for your beverage. 
Once the Barista has produced your beverage, the Waiter delivers it to you.
